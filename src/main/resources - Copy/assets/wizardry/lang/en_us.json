    "wizardry.book.steps.mana.title": "Step 1: Mana",
    "wizardry.book.steps.mana.desc": "Learn about what mana is and why you want it so badly",
    "wizardry.book.steps.mana.content0": "Of all the energy sources a wizard can draw on, mana is the best. Light blue pools of this watery liquid can be found throughout the world; it also manifests itself in people and objects, giving a trained wizard a constant source of energy to draw on. With it, you can begin to be a threat in the world of wizardry, and begin to work magic.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.mana.content1": "A fair warning, the liquid is barely stable. Think of it as a river. A small flow of water is nice to relax in and drift along with, but a raging rapid is not something you want to jump in the way of. Touching it will drain your hunger as it tries to purge your body, while also making you float due to the sheer energy of the liquid. As a result, it's next to impossible to drown in it.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.mana.content2": "Now of course, we want to get this liquid into our bodies to use it. To get mana inside of you, craft a syringe and craft that syringe with a mana orb or hold down the syringe pointing at some mana liquid in the world. You now have a mana syringe that you can inject straight into your bloodstream.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.mana.content3": "Just like anything else, too much mana is a bad thing.. Drinking too much water can pose a threat to your health. Doing the same with mana is several magnitudes more dangerous. The body can only store a certain amount before it starts to manifest side effects known as \"mana burn\".<br>Imagine you took all of the world's animal life, gave them all pure caffeine, compressed them into a single squirrel, and then made that squirrel a wizard.<br>That's what having mana burn is like.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.mana.content4": "Finally, you can store the mana liquid into orbs. Simply craft glass orbs and throw them a block of liquid mana, it will instantly fill up. You now have portable mana that you will need later. Do stock up on this stuff, you'll need a lot of it.",

    "wizardry.book.steps.garbs.title": "Step 2: Garbs",
    "wizardry.book.steps.garbs.desc": "Learn about wardrobe you should be using",
    "wizardry.book.steps.garbs.content0": "Once you've injected mana, you might be wondering why you don't have a bar showing you how much you have. Well although the mana is flowing in your blood stream right now, you simply cannot channel it yet.<br>Angels are bits of divinity. Their Grace allows them to have a constant supply of mana... but you don't have it that easy. You'll have to make do with what's called a crude halo, instead of the glorious one of an angel.<br> Once you equip the crude halo, you will be able to see your mana bar.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.garbs.content1": "Next up is the cape. Capes are not storages, but they are conduits, aiding wizards in mana transference and reducing mana loss. Once you craft yourself a cape, wear it and do not take it off. The cape will get stronger the longer you wear it. At first, it barely reduces spell cost, but after you wear it for prolonged periods of time, it can reduce mana spell cost down to a quarter of what it was.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.garbs.content2": "Capes may be glorious and powerful, but they are fickle. They will easily give up their loyalty to another, because one wizard is the same as another to them. If you can cheat a master out of their cape, it's the same as if you'd worn it for years yourself.<br>So if you do happen to find a beautiful, billowing cape on another's rapidly-cooling body, there's no harm in peeling it off and trying it on. And really, does it matter how they died? A cape is a cape.",

    "wizardry.book.steps.nacre.title": "Step 3: Nacre",
    "wizardry.book.steps.nacre.desc": "Learn about pearls and their magical properties",
    "wizardry.book.steps.nacre.content0": "Nacre, the liquid that pearls are formed from - known as mother-of-pearl - is a very thick, pale, and iridescent liquid that is able to channel mana quite flawlessly.<br>To get this liquid, simply throw a gold nugget into liquid mana, and they'll mix together into the resplendent stuff.<br>Now, as for why you want this: with it you can create \"nacre pearls\", which can be infused with spells to cast them.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.nacre.content1": "To make a nacre pearl, take a glass orb and throw it in the milky liquid. There are six levels of nacre pearl quality. Wasted is the worst, then drained, flawed, decent, potent, and finally, Apex. You ideally want Apex Pearls, but that takes careful effort to make. The worse the quality of the pearl, the weaker the spell and the more mana it consumes. To get the highest pearl quality, you must keep the glass orb in the nacre for &oexactly&r 30 seconds. Any more reduces quality, but any less does too. This isn't required, of course. Apex pearls are good, but  you will do fine with potent and decent quality pearls.<br>You will be using these pearls later on in spell infusion.",

    "wizardry.book.steps.structures.title": "Step 4: Structures",
    "wizardry.book.steps.structures.desc": "Learn about the structure you will need to build",
    "wizardry.book.steps.structures.content0": "You've got your mana, you've got your crooked halo, you've got your beautiful cape, and you've got your shimmering nacre pearls. But how do you actually infuse a spell into a pearl? Well, we just need one last device before we get there.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.structures.content1": "The first structure is a Mana Battery. This structure is a massive reservoir of mana.<br>As any wizard will quickly learn, this is the center of your powers. The Mana Battery's core can absorb mana far more efficiently than any other method of storage. To fill it, set mana orbs on the pillars in its structure; it will discharge its power to mana orbs outside of the battery's pillars, allowing for automatic and efficient mana transfer out of the battery.",
    "wizardry.book.steps.structures.content2": "Do note that once you place the mana battery block down, you will see red dots highlighting where blocks of the structures are going to be. Shift right click the block to display a hologram of the structure itself. Adjust the battery's position as you please. Once you finish the structure, no red dots should be flashing.",

Then hold down right click and drag from the Shape component to the Effect component on your paper, you will see a connecting line. This line's direction matters, and connecting it in reverse won't work. This is because doing it like this tells your spell that it will first run a Projectile Shape, then when that Projectile Shape hits and needs to run its Effect, it will run the Effect you pass into it. The opposite is an Effect shape that doesn't know how to actually start, so it fizzles out.<br>Try this example: Drag a Projectile Shape and a Freeze Effect and right click drag from the Projectile Shape to the Freeze Effect.",
